Run Chimp / cucumber tests slower and with visual cues so you can actually see what's happening

This is a personal project and a work in progress. Good news is that the source code is currently so little that you can figure it out very easily.

The idea is to slow BDD tests and had a fake mouse pointer to the web page so you can actually see what's happening.
This should be specially usefull if you're running something like Chimp that run the selected tests on every code change.
